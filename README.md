# Spherical-Harmonics-and-AI-s-Latent-Space-for-3D-Geometry

To Whom It May concern,

my hypothesis is that spherical harmonics, particularly their hierarchy from low to high orders, naturally map to the semantic and canonical structures within an AI's intrinsically learned latent space for 3D geometry. Certain configurations of spherical harmonics—those with zero higher-order coefficients—correspond to fundamental, "natural" representations of objects within a generative model's latent space.

Imagine a generative model tasked with creating 3D objects, such as NPCs with parametric variability. A head and face can be approximated by a sphere. Instead of the model learning directly from voxels, point clouds, or polygonal meshes, it would learn to work with spherical harmonic coefficients.

Essentially, the generative model would learn to "speak the language" of spherical harmonics. This would not only allow it to generate 3D content more efficiently but also control it with a certain degree of precision and semantic understanding.
